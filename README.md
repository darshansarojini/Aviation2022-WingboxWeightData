# Data in the repository
The data is broadly categorized into three types:
1. Aircraft files: geometry as OpenVSP files, aerodynamic model as AVL files, and structural model as Nastran .bdf files
2. HTML files that allow for interactive visualization of the design space
3. Surrogate model of the structural weight as a function of the design variables provided as python functions
